	* Improved r_softShadows quality and speed with irregular shadowmap sampling like in Crysis
	* Implemented Exponential Variance Shadow Mapping to fight the VSM light bleeding problems

	* Fixed bugs concerning r_vboDeformVertexes
	* Added more ET specific keywords to the .shader parser
	* Added top-down view for r_showBspNodes
	* Added engine version to the console
	* Updated JPG loader to libjpeg 8c

ETXMap
	* Improved ETXMap -map2map -format quake3 using additional support for worldspawn detail brushes
	* Improved ETXMap -map2map -format quake3 to support texture coordinates without GtkRadiant 1.4
	* Improved alternate BSP splitter algorithm for faster map compiles and better rendering speeds
	* Updated JPG loader to libjpeg 8c
	* Changed Unix home dir from .etwolf to .etxreal
