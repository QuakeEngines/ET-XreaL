 * greebo: An OctreeNode is the atomic unit part of an Octree.
 * 
 * Each OctreeNode is axis-aligned and has valid bounds at all times,
 * and can have either 0 or exactly 8 children of equal size.
 *
 * The linkRecursively() method can be used to pass down scene::INodes and
 * add them as members to the one OctreeNode which is suiting them best.
 * 
 * The link/unlink events are communicated to the owning Octree such that
 * it has a chance to maintain its lookup table (the NodeMapping).
 *
 * Once a leaf OctreeNode exceeds a given amount of members (SUBDIVISION_THRESHOLD)
 * it will subdivide itself and re-link its members into its children.
