/**
 * greebo: An Octree is a simple way to subdivide the entire space 
 * used by a collectivity of nodes in a scene. This is achieved by using cubic 
 * axis aligned OctreeNodes, which form a hierarchical tree.
 * 
 * The topmost OctreeNode (the root) is a cube large enough to encompass 
 * all linked nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Starting from the root, each OctreeNode in the tree can be further 
 * subdivided to have exactly 8 child nodes of equal size, hence the name. 
 *
 * This subdivision takes place when a certain amount of members (scene::INodes) 
 * is exceeded - i.e. the Octree will dynamically subdivide itself on the fly, 
 * until a certain lower limit is reached (usually the smallest OctreeNode 
 * is a cube with an edge length of 256 units).
 *
 * The root OctreeNode's extents cannot be any larger than 65535 units.
 *
 * Each scene::INode is linked to exactly one OctreeNode, namely the smallest possible
 * one. When the scene::INode's bounds cannot exactly be squeezed into exactly 
 * one OctreeNode, the scene::INode remains in the one parent node able to do so. 
 * In the "worst" case this is the root node itself.
 *
 * The Octree maintains a lookup table (NodeMapping) to implement a fast unlink()
 * algorithm. The scene::INodes don't know or care where they are linked to, so
 * it needs a fast lookup to avoid having to traverse the entire tree to find and
 * remove a single node.
