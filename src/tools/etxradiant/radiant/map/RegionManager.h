 * 			to set the region bounds from brushes/xyview/current selection.
 * 
 * Regioned nodes are hidden during map editing (they get their excluded bit set).
 * It's still possible to apply additional filtering to a region via show/hide,
 * these systems are independent of each other.
 * 
 * @SaveRegion: This saves the current region (all non-excluded nodes) to a
 * 				specified file and places six wall/floor/ceiling brushes to
 * 				the file together with an info_player_start entity.
 * 				The info_player_start is placed at the current camera position.
