/* greebo: a PatchControlInstance basically consists of two parts: an ObservedSelectable and a PatchControl itself
 * 
 * The PatchControl is a struct defined in ipatch.h and consists of a vertex and texture coordinates.
 * 
 * The ObservedSelectable is needed to inform the SelectionSystem about the selection changes. Everytime the
 * selection state is altered, it calls the <observer> it has been passed in its constructor.
 * 
 * The ObservedSelectable is then passing itself to the PatchNode and from there further on to the SelectionSystem,
 * so that everything "keeps track of itself" (counters for example).
