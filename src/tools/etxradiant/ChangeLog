19/10/2002
SPoG - spog_branch - experimental - work-in-progress
- added scene graph library: defines interfaces, generic graph node types,
  re-usable systems for traversals, traversal paths, node containers,
  multiple-instance caching of world-space-transforms/bounding-volumes/visibility.
- added scene graph traversals to replace all traversals of 'active_brushes',
  'selected_brushes', 'filtered_brushes' and 'entities' linked-lists.
- added view module: view-volume-culling system acting on the scene graph,
  uses scene heirarchy to minimise culling tests per frame.
- added opengl-state module: sorts opengl-state objects (shaders) to minimise
  opengl state changes during rendering.
- added renderer module: culls objects outside the view volume,
  gathers non-culled renderable objects from the scene graph,
  keeps track of state during traversal, adds renderable objects to correct opengl-state.
- added selection module: sets view volume to the selection box/ray, culls
  objects outside the view volume, gathers non-culled selectable objects
  from the scene graph (entity/primitive/component),
  selects gathered objects (select/toggle/cycle) or moves things if already-selected.
- added patch module: encapsulates a patch as a scene graph node,
  optimised patch tesselation.
- added brush module: encapsulates a brush as a scene graph node,
  adapts multiple-brush operations to use the scene graph.
- adapted entity module: encapsulates an entity as a scene graph node/subtree,
  shares common code between different visualised entity types.
- adapted model module: encapsulates a model as a scene graph node/subtree.
- added undo module: completely new compact infinite-undo-system,
  operates on undoable objects, uses minimal-state data to store objects,
  uses refcounting to undo "deleted" objects.

TODO: cleanup: many simple things are still broken or not functioning in the right way..
see !\todo items in the code (not all are documented yet though).
Selection module probably needs refactoring some more - perhaps split off the move-already-selected stuff.
The dependencies are still pretty bad.. need to refactor stdafx.h/qertypes.h.
Some of the above modules are not really modules, they're static-linked to the core, but could easily be dynamic-linked.
The interfaces to brushes and entities still expose brush_t and entity_t for backwards-compatibility.
NOTE: some todos are #if 0 because their functionality is (or will be) replaced by the new systems.

TTimo
- http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=815
  found out about string_t that slept through my reviews

Updated list of broken stuff on this branch:

- include/bytestream.h: remove this file, extend idatastream.h header
from the code conventions:
  include/ directory:
  This directory is holding the API header files for the synapse modules (plus a few build control and version related headers)
  All headers that describe synapse APIs should start with an i: ishader.h igl.h 

  The few files in include/ that don't start with a lowercase i are specific files for build control and configuration.
  Regular developement never creates non i-prefixed files in include/
  
the merge with IDataStream goes like this (note the corrected class names):
class IInputStream
class IOutputStream

class IDataStream : public IInputStream, IOutputStream

class ISeekableStream
class ISeekableInputStream : public IInputStream, public ISeekableStream
class ISeekableOutputStream : public IOutputStream, public ISeekableStream

typedef unsigned int size_type; goes away, use size_t

- include/iarchive.h

renamed VisitorFunc to IArchiveVisitor
move it out of IArchive class (keep it in iarchive.h though)
from code conventions:
  Don't declare classes inside classes. Makes the code harder to read and isn't useful to anything.

- remove libs/bytestreamutils.h
put that functionality into the IStream stuff / idatastream.h stuff
anything you retrieve from an IStream should be endian-correct

- libs/filestream.h
I'd rather see a header without embedded code, and a .cpp file for it

- libs/fs_filesystem.h libs/fs_path.h
those totally lack documentation about what they are doing
same as above. way too much embedded code. makes things harder to maintain. implement in a .cpp
and as usual, name the classes correctly, C and I prefixes

- gamespecific_t: rename correctly to CGameSpecific
I like the idea of gathering all hardocded game-specific behaviours inside one same class.
But is it really the topic of bug800?

- gamespecific_executable_t: rename correctly to CGameSpecificExecutable
shouldn't this be merged with CGameSpecific?

12/05/2003
SPoG
- Fixed win32 build error (win32 has no <dirent.h>).
- Added dir_good() check to handle failure of dir_open() in posix DIR wrapper.
- Renamed dynamic_string_t and path_t to DynamicString and UnixPath respectively.
- Removed unnecessary use of 'inline' and 'virtual' keywords in class definitions (bad habit).
- Documented archive interface.

- some easy fixes to get it to startup on Linux
- tagging the current source as bug800-spog, preparing rollback


SPoG
- Added an implementation of IArchive to do OS filesystem access.
- Changed vfspk3 to use above implementation for OS filesystem access.
- Added const qualifiers to vfsGetFullPath and everything dependant on it.
- Changed vfsGetFileList to use "*" to indicate all-files instead of a NULL pointer.
- Extended IArchive interface to allow for extra filesystem functionality.
  Added method to check if a file exists quickly.
  Added method to traverse the filesystem with control on start-dir and depth of recursion.
- Defined implementation requirements for IArchive.
  An archive contains a heirarchy of directories and files, and may contain empty directories.
  An archive can be traversed in directory order.
  Directories can be distinguished from files during a traversal.
  Directory paths will always end with a separator.
  File entries can be opened as an IArchiveFile.
  IArchiveFile provides a simple non-seekable input stream which can only be read forwards.
  Any number of files may be opened and read from an archive simultaneously.
  An archive may be released while one or more files are still open, the files will remain valid until released.
- Changed archivepak, archivezip and archivewad to implement all IArchive requirements.
- Factored common code from archive implementations out into new lib/headers:
  fs_filesystem.h: a templated filesystem container, with iterators and efficient traversal.
  fs_path.h: a dynamic filesystem path object, with separator checking and efficient memory management.
  ibytestream.h: abstract interfaces for input byte streams.
  bytestream.h: utilities operating on abstract input byte streams.
  filestream.h: a c++ wrapper for stdc FILE object, implementing a seekable input stream.
- Added a new pkzip-reader implementation, designed to be orthogonal to the compression library used.
- Added a zlib input stream object, which decompresses data from an abstract byte stream on the fly.
- Removed archivezip code copy/pasted/hacked from zlib and unzip.c, replaced by pkzip-reader and zlib input stream.
- Changed vfsLoadFile to return 0 for a zero-sized file, only returning -1 if it failed to load the file.
- Removed halflife-specific disabling of shader-loading, thereby allowing common-hydra.shader to work.
- Added archivezip, archivewad and archivepak to win32 setup scripts.
- Updated win32 setup scripts for halflife media.
- Updated cons scripts for archivezip, archivewad and archivepak.
- Added printing of warnings when vfs functions are given invalid input paths.

  `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --libs`
  -Wl,--export-dynamic -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lm -lpangoxft-1.0 -lpangox-1.0 -lpango-1.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -ldl -lglib-2.0
  http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_2.html#SEC3
  --export-dynamic
    When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table. 
    The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time. 
    If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols 
    which are referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link. If you use dlopen to load 
    a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than 
    some other dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when linking the program 
    itself.
  this causes symbol confusion, shaders.so's g_ShaderTable suddenly resolves to the core's g_ShaderTable
  one is a 'shaders' API, the other an 'appshaders' .. everything gets badly mixed up
  added a check in the cons script, using `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --libs-only-L` `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --libs-only-l`
  (same for gtkglext)

- having the linux version compile and start again. took out numerous elements while merging, built a list of TODO stuff
  the main thing to do being to bring the win32 build back up too, then to go through TODO list and fix stuff
  until the win32 version runs too, I check this in to a seperate branch merge-1_2_10-post
- There is quite a massive update in mainframe.cpp switch case for all events.
  Looks like it's just a reordering of stuff, but it looks bad in the diffs.
- added m_MapReg pattern

- At some point, I'm thinking that forcing correct TAB/SPACE conversion on the server end would be a good thing to have.
  Nazisticly forcing the formatting sounds like the only viable solution.

      		- Stitching the edges of lightmaps on patches that wrap around (cyls and cones)
        		so the seam is no longer visible
      		- The -patchmeta switch works better now, the patches are still stored in the
        		BSP for collision, but are pre-tesselated into nonplanar meta surfaces for
        		more efficient rendering
      		- Better, more uniform lightmap sample position finding on patch meshes
      		- Moved q3map_tcMod and q3map_alphaMod processing to the final phase

        		origin relative to the raw lightmap's bounding box
      		- New: -debugcluster switch on light mode. Colors lightmaps based on the pvs
        		cluster the luxel falls into
      		- New: -convert switch to convert BSP to ASE file (experimental)
      		- New: q3map_lightmapmergable directive to allow terrain to be mapped onto a

  		- fixed bug in jpeg loading code (4 components instead of 3 for RGB images, mh)

    		- Merged with latest CVS, fixed minor issues with matrix order
    		- Fixed minor Sys_FPrintf/Sys_Printf substitution typo in Q3Map2
    		- Expanded debug colors to 12 for debugging surface meshes
    		- PicoModel: fixed ASE loader to support > 1 texture coordinate per-vertex,
      		so more models supported correctly, also loading vertex normals
    		- PicoModel: md3 shader names are now cleaned. Suffixes (such as .tga or .jpg)
      		are stripped, and \ path separators are changed to /
    		- New: Add :q3map to the end of any shader name, and it will be interpreted as
      		the named shader minus :q3map. Example:
      		textures/shaderlab/concrete:q3map -> textures/shaderlab/concrete
      		One potential use is the -approx feature to collapse lightmapped  surfaces
      		into vertexlit surfaces, saving lightmap space/memory
    		- New: q3map_clipModel -- does what you think it does, sort of. This code ix
      		really experimental, and should *only* be used on large models such as terrain
      		(not small decorative models). This code will be evolving. Note: the shader's
      		surfaceparms are inherited by the magic clip brush, so if you have nonsolid
      		in your model's shader that uses q3map_clipModel, then the brush will also
      		be nonsolid

    		- Bug 654 (http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=654):
      		Fixed problem where brush faces, drawsurfaces, and surfaceparms weren't living
      		together in perfect harmony (terrain surfaceparms now inherited by brushes)
    		- Nodraw fog works now, albeit when you're underneath, surfaces above don't get
      		fogged properly. Could be good for foggy water where you want the above-water
      		portions to only be occluded by the water surface
    		- Bug 656 (http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=656):
      		Number of lightgrid points displayed (byte size is currently out of proportion
      		due to internal storage format) when Q3Map is called with the -info switch
    		- Fixed wack surface merging bug where code would attempt to merge triangles not
      		adjacent to the current set, causing bad lightmap projections on nonplanar
      		surfaces
    		- Fixed tiny 1-character bug in 2d lightmap texture allocator where adjacent
      		luxels were being checked for occlusion rather than the actual source luxel
    		2.3.27
    		- Fixed minor bug in scriplib bugfix where the last character in a file wasn't
      		being read.
    		- Fixed bug where 0-area or bogus triangles were causing crash in MapRawLightmap
      		if they used a shader with a normalmap (thanks ShadowSpawn)
    		- Fixed bug where lightmaps were getting hosed levelwide on a prerelease version
      		of 2.3.27
    		- Fixed bug where lightmaps were getting knackered on models and certain patches
    		- Merged latest PicoModel version from seaw0lf, adding support for ASE and WF OBJ
      		models (preliminary)

    		2.3.26
    		- Now using GtkRadiant's libpng and zlib config (linked as DLLs)
    		- Fixed bug in script parser where repeat calls to GetToken() were causing
      		memory corruption
    		- Fixed SOF2 -rename bug
    		- When using -game sof2 or -game jk2, the -flares argument is implied
    		- Added -noflares argument to disable the above behavior
    		- Added support for flares on entities. Use one of the following keys:
      		"_flare" "1" -- use default flare (different for each game)
      		"_flareshader" "path/to/flareshader" -- use a specific flare shader
      		Note: This only matters in SOF2/JK2 now. Make a light targetted (a spotlight)
      		to get it to aim the correct direction, otherwise it defaults to pointing 
      		downward. You cannot have omnidirectional flares
    		- Lightgrid size is automatically increased to accomodate large maps. The
      		MAX_MAP_LIGHTGRID error will never happen again
  		- Update PicoModel to 0.8.7 sources
    		- ASE support
			- Alias|Wavefront OBJ support

      		to understand/legacy).

    		NOTE: 'angles' is q3map2 only
    		NOTE: could manipulate angles directly from the views (2d and 3d with some handles)

    		NOTE TO SELF: 
      		<TTimo> hey guys .. just a quick question if you don't mind .. I'm trying to track a Gtk-WARNING .. is there a way to make those apps cause a break to track them easily ?
      		<andersca> just run your app with --g-fatal-warnings

    		TODO: add new bitmap to win32 & linux setups
    		TODO: don't use exports for the plugin toolbar, use entry functions
      		do something like CPlugIn::InitBSPFrontendPlugin
    		TODO: botclip is broken with the new Brush_Ray code  

    		initial ChangeLog for the patch:

      		28-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Added 'angles' support for models (misc_model/misc_gamemodel).
	      		+ Prevented pivot drawing of model from scaling and rotating.
	      		+ Cleaned up the dropdown boxes in the preferences a bit (all use 
      		tables now, so not multiline).
	      		+ Added 'Classic Key Setup' option to camera paint select configuration, this 
      		drag-selects with ctrl+alt instead of shift.
	      		+ Changed XYWnd::PositionView to position on the center of the 
      		selection, not on the mins.

      		27-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Added in-editor light envelope drawing. Outer circle is max envelope, 
      		inner fullbright radius. Optional classic mode emulates the similar drawing 
      		from Rituals and Ravens tools (not q3map correct, easier for the level designer 
      		to understand/legacy).

      		26-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Upped MAX_TEXTUREDIRS to 256 (from 128).

      		25-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Fixed patches not being drawn in XY window with colour of parent 
      		entity.
	      		+ Made paste to camera snap destination spot snap to grid.

      		18-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Changed Select_Reselect to be much faster.

      		12-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Fixed curve point drag-selection area not showing properly in XY 
      		views.
	      		+ Fixed size info breaking over 9999.9 units.
	      		+ Fixed AllocateSelectedPatchHandles not setting patchesmode to 
      		ESelectedPatches.
	      		+ Changed the horizontal and vertical tc shift spin control to have a 
      		limit of 8192.
	      		+ Moved SPoG's implementation of redisperse cols to a seperate function 
      		and reinstated the old code.
	      		+ Added 'Paste to Camera', shortcut Alt+V, which pastes the contents of 
      		the clipboard to the current camera origin.
	      		+ Added centerview functionality to 4 window mode. Ctrl+tab will focus 
      		on the selection, or if non existant, on the camera.

      		11-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Made sure settings set in savedinfo.bin get initialized to their 
      		proper defaults.
	      		+ Added botclip filter (filters *botclip* and *monsterclip*).

      		10-09-2002
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Removed .reg from normal map saving, can only save as region 
      		using 'Save region'.
	      		+ Added outline style cycling (j) cycle between z buffered outlines and 
      		selected colour rendering.
	      		+ Added colour dialog to pick the colour of selected surfaces in the 
      		camwindow.
	      		+ Third coordinate for clip points now gets set to the center of the 
      		selection.
	      		+ Changed arbitrary rotation dialog to accept negative angles as well.
	      		+ Changed texture alignment dialog to accept values up to 2 decimal 
      		points.
	      		+ Fixed entity inspector to say 'Textures:' in the window title.
        		NOTE: still broke in floating window mode
	      		+ Changed entity inspector so that tab doesn't clear the epair value 
      		field anymore, so it retains the value while jumping to it.
	      		+ Disabling camera paint-select now returns selection behaviour for groups to 
      		the old behaviour as well (shift+click selects whole group).
	      		+ Changed load_plugin_bitmap to load bitmaps from g_strAppPath if 
      		g_strGameToolsPath fails.
	      		+ Added plugin toolbar and api.
	      		+ Fixed m_pfnCommitBrushHandleToEntity, wasn't creating brushes 
      		properly (well, not at all really).

      		Older changes:
			    		Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	      		+ Added misc_gamemodel drawing.
	      		+ Ported camera paint-select over from 1.3.
	      		+ Fixed statusbar display of text (removed a bunch of \n's).
	      		+ Added area selection in 3d view for patches.

  Hydra
  - #197, HL support update

11/12/2002
  TTimo
  - added cmdlib dependency to mapq3.so (fixes unresolved)

25/10/2002
  Hydra
  - vfsGetFullPath() can now (optionally) search PK3/WAD files
  - Half-life map loading is now un-borked (my original patch worked
    but some conditional code in the patch was incorrectly applied.
    That, coupled with the missing vfsFileExists and vfsFindFile replacements)
  - A patch to imagehl/lbmlib.cpp/LoadIDSP() was missed out, causing all sprite
    models to be reverse-rendered (due to an inverted alphamask)
  - Renamed HydraToolz to HydraToolz-HL as it's half-life specific
    changed project files and renamed all appropriate files and directories
    (for the merge, just delete contrib/hydratoolz and apply the diff)

  - Comments on previous notes:

    - TODO: need to rationalize where the modules are placed and identify HL specific modules
      (this affects the build system / post build step too)
      imagehl and spritemodel are halflife specific and can be placed in
        either $coreradiantdir/modules or $hlradiantdir/modules
        I've updated the .dsp files so that they are copied to $coreradiantdir/modules
        spritemodel can actually be used for other engines, not just HL so it makes sense
        to keep it in $coreradiantdir/modules
      hydratoolz is a half-life specific plugin and must go in $hlradiantdir/modules as it
        is NOT to be used for any other engines.  I've also updated the "about text" to
        reflect this.

  - spritemodels in build system
  - applying HL setup patch (att 270, bug 197)
    - the templating went one filename seperator too far, causing all *.fgl to be modified .. 
      fixed so that we only have the relevant changes
    - modules added to main Executable Files, TODO for later will need to identify what is HL specific
    - .game generation: don't want enginename yet, gamename is ok
    - updated HL .game generation for eclass_singleload and no_patch   
    - update hydratoolz location in setup
    - update maphl in synapse.config

07/06/2002
  TTimo
  - realized that \func doesn't work in doxygen, should be \fn (updated everywhere)
  - http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=197
    applying the HL patch (see original list of changes below)
    - ugly eclass API changes
      eclassfgd/plugin.cpp.rej, eclass API changes involved, a bunch of .rej
      SupportsMultiple tries to send configuration information from the eclass format file module to the eclass manager
      dropping it, using a proper configuration node instead (eclass_singleload)
    - added "no_patch" prop to disable patch support
      the patch toolbar prompts are only present in prefs if there is patch support
      otherwise everything is force-disabled
    - PFN_VFSFINDFILE PFN_VFSFILEEXISTS:
      one of the problems we have is that the 'manager' code and file format code are in the same module
      (i.e. vfspk3 / vfswad: two formats, but the manager part is pretty much the same)
      vfsFindFile(relative filename):
        this worked by searching through the list of loaded pk3/wad files for the file
        then trying to search through the search directories
        - wasn't properly documented about what it does / how is the search performed
        - not consistent with existing code, duplicate of vfsGetFullPath for the most part
          can't be added to the VFS API as-is, it would confuse the interface
        - usage of vfsFindFile in the code doesn't justify the way it proceeds for search
        foxing it, replacing by calls to vfsGetFullPath
      vfsFileExists(relative filename):
        returns wether a file exist, can be flagged to search in pk3/wad or straight filesystem
        - this is a duplicate / particular case of vfsGetFileCount
        foxing it too, we need to extend and update vfsGetFileCount instead
    - mapq3: the changes completely fucked q3 map parsing
      need reorganization. same module provides parsing for all .map based formats
      we use wrappers around the actual calls and globals in the module to select formats
      MAPVERSION_Q2 and MAPVERSION_Q1 don't need to be there yet, they are not supported
      MAPVERSION_HL means WC >= 2.2
      (when introduced, MAPVERSION_Q2 would be Q2 or qer+hl plugin (same))
      MAPVERSION_HL uses "maphl" minor name (instead of mapq2)
      cleaned up the Q3 read/write code that got broken
      cleaned up various commenting/hack that deal with Q2!=HL format .. we'll see about Q2 when we actually do it
      bad cut and paste from cmdlib code, using actual dependency to cmdlib instead (see below for some cmdlib updates)
    - took out all SafeRead SafeWrite code from cmdlib, removed annoying cmdlib dependency to Error function
      all file access go through VFS module, the cmdlib 07/06/2002 15:47file code was way old  
    - radiant/points.cpp pointfile code changes (that's used only for non-monitored compiling now)
    - applied patch 267 (hydratoolz fixes)
    - commented out some bworldcraft flagged stuff in mapq3/parse.cpp
    - updated the .dsw .dsp to compile and copy HL stuff  
    - TODO: need to rationalize where the modules are placed and identify HL specific modules
    - TODO: seems to be a synapse crash when unloading plugins (hydratools)
      (looks like I didn't look at the plugin unload code yet actually)  
    - TODO: make sure HL setup puts eclass_singleload="1" and no_patch="1" 
    - TODO: WATCHBSP_KEY and TEXTURE_KEY hardcoded for HL need cleanup
    - TODO: imagehl duplicates some image functionality
      imagehl is supposed to be only for HL-specific image formats
      it 'adds' the required formats to the stuff that image makes available for everyone already
    - TODO: HL doesn't have a BSP menu!  
    - TODO: rename mapq3/ into map/, the map module handles all .map formats
    - TODO: it's likely that we only need a vfs/ module instead of vfspk3/ and vfspak/
      think about it, see if we really act on this (or do we need to abstract the manager and some file format modules)
    - TODO: HL synapse.config needs to use maphl
    - TODO: wtf is enginename="quake2" in hl.game
    - TODO: I don't have a sample HL map to play with, so I didn't test the changes against

    - Patched in some CVS changes and fixed a little issue with the
      new entity file loader code.

      Selected Entity Bounding Box obscured by brushes fix.
    - Moved the "wad" keypair creation code from the Map module into
      a new plugin called HydraToolz, this means that wad keypair is
      done manually by the user, as in fact it should be.  (as the
      order of the wads is actually important).
    - Fixed a problem with the wads in the wad list being re-ordered.
  
  27/5/2002
    Hydra
    - Created an inital implementation of a sprite model plugin.
      According to the powers that be, it seems creating a model
      plugin is hackish.
      It works ok, but there is no way to attach models (sprites if you will)
      to non-fixedsize entities (like func_bombtarget)
      Also, I can't get the alpha map stuff right so I had to invert the alpha
      mask in the spr loader so that 0xff = not drawn pixel.
  
  17/5/2002
    Hydra
    - "Wad" keypairs are now used when loading a map and speeds up map loading
      significantly. This sorts out quite a few issues that could otherwise occur.
    - Map loader now uses textures from wads listed in the the "wad" keypair first.
    - Added a texture name mapping cache system to the .map loader
      this significantly improves load times of maps that don't store texture
      names along with paths (e.g. "mytexture" not "mytextures/mytexture".)
    - Added vfsFileExists() to the vfs table (for above) and added it to
      vfspk3 and vfswad
    - Map loading and saving times are printed to the console.
    - Wad file names from the "wad" key pair are logged to the console when
      a map is loaded
    - The user is informed if the textures loaded were not found in the
      wad files in the "wad" keypair.
    - The user is informed if the textures was not found in any wad file at all
      (Q2/HL only, the shader module still gives you similar information for other
      games when a shader activation fails)
  
  
  8/5/2002
    Hydra
    - Added basic support in mapq3 for reading maps saved by Worldcraft 2.2+
      in .map format (It uses [ ]'s round some of the texture co-ordinates)
      TODO: do we need to be able to save a map in this format too ?
    - Added support for loading ZHLT style point files (*.lin)
    - Added wad filename information when loading textures.
      (This helps take the ambiguity out of which wad files textures come from,
      so that we can correctly setup the worldspawn "wads" e-pair manually.)
      Note: This will be removed when the "wads" worldspawn key is built by radiant.
    - added vfsFindFile() to vfs table.
    - VFSWAD: vfsLoadFile() no longer ignores paths when loading textures
      (this was by design, but the design has changed for the better)
    - When loading a Quake2 map file, vfsFindFile() is used to find the actual path of
      the shader/texture being loaded.
      This fixes all the weird issues that crop up when we were able to use non
      wad-relative texture names (<shader>) and wad-relative(<wadname>/<shader>).
      (such as having an image loaded twice in memory.)
      We also now get the correct shader name in the suface inspector too.
      Note: not sure if this code should stay in the map parser, or wether it should
      be moved to where shaders are first initialised.
      Note: maybe this needs to be when a halflife map is loaded, not specifically a
      quake2 map file.
    - added EClass_SupportsMultiple to the EClass loader API.
      Note: this is poop.  FGD files can be additive but radiant makes it so they can't be.
      This function would not be needed if the eclass loader itself took care of the init,
      rather then the manager taking care of the init.  Also note that if the loader were
      to take care of the init then FGD files *CAN* be additive, as it's not down to the
      format of the FGD files.  However, it'll do for the moment because all the supplied
      FGD files that come with halflife and it's mods are meant to be used one at a time.
    - removed support for having an additional (not external) eclass loader.
      Just ifdef'd for now, grep for USEADDITIONALECLASSLOADER.
      We never mix entity definition formats and synapse.config allows us to just have the
      right one and also there is no mechanism for setting g_bHaveEClassExt anymore.
    - Texture subset on by default for halflife.
    - default texture scale is now set to 1 instead of 0.5 for halflife.
      (needs to be 1 for q1/q2 too)
    - patch toolbar disabled by default for halflife and it's also disabled
      in the preferences so it can't be turned back on)
      (needs to be 1 for q1/q2 too)
    - bsp monitoring disabled by default for halflife
    - When you drop a light entity the epair "_light" is used instead of "light" (halflife specific)
    - removed -fs_game additions to the map compiler commands; ZHLT doesn't support it.
    - saving of contents/flags/values in q2 format maps disabled (ZHLT doesn't like em !#?!)
      TODO: re-enable for Q2 (but not halflife) format maps when we can
      can figure out what game/engine combo we're using from within a module
    - configured mapq3 to have dynamic VFS API too
    - Added halflife shaderlist.txt parsing back in, it's actually useful
      afterall (for editor shaders).

  - merging 1.2.7 -> 1.2.9 changes into 1.3, merge notes:
    - the win32 .dsp are a bit different, using the $(CORERADIANTDIR) post build commands now
    - merged in the JKII/STVEF hardcoded chunks, should probably check that everything is still fine on that end
      was setting the "dir" epair in project files intead of "gamename" like all other games?
      (which should really be "fs_game" anyway, I wonder who decided to call it "gamename")
    - rebuilt a setup. we have a problem with RADIANT_MAJOR RADIANT_MINOR it seems
    TODO: setup needs to use GtkRadiant-1.<MAJOR> as basename in start menu, and base for installation
    C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.3 and C:\quake3\Radiant-1.3 etc. for the game packs

	- using RADIANT_MAJOR_VERSION and RADIANT_MINOR_VERSION for the version info, this was conflicting with synapse
	
	- m_strHomeMaps
	http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/GtkRadiant/include/qertypes.h.diff?r1=1.27&r2=1.28&only_with_tag=MAIN
	http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/archives/gtkradiant/2002-February/002170.html
	posted on the ML, bringing it back in from 1.2
	
	setup scripts:
	  easily merged, as the 1.3 scripts have not been touched mostly
	
	qe3.cpp conflict:
	  1.2 tweaks stuff in the QE_*Project* functions
		1.3 has them mostly commented out
		applying manually where relevant
		the project settings stuff is very different, and the changes can't be applied as is
		given the fixes I had to do in 1.2, I'd expect the current 1.3 version to be fairly broken
		a complete kill and rewrite of the prefs/project stuff might be our option anyway
		http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/archives/gtkradiant/2002-May/003038.html
	qe3.cpp QE_InitVFS conflict:
	  1.3 has some changes when creating the files in a new userprefix (ex. ~/.q3a/baseq3/scripts /maps /maps/prefabs etc.)
		merged by hand, probably needs to be checked
	qe3.cpp OpenDialog SaveAsDialog conflict:
	  commented out in 1.3, getting rid of it completely
	
	preferences.cpp conflict:
	  1.2 adds CUSTOMSHADEREDITOR_KEY pref
		1.3 uses a completely different syntax for prefs
	preferences.cpp conflict:
		prefab path pref changes conflict with 1.3 pref syntax
		applying changes manually to 1.3 codebase
	
	pmesh.cpp conflict:
		1.2 adds pref to group / not group patch thickening
		1.3 changes the way we manipulate entities around that code
		merged manually, would be worth checking that the thicken pref works
	
	pluginmanager.cpp conflicts: synapse completely changes that part
	on relevant 1.2 thing is the removal of pfnRadiant_Free
	
  map.cpp Map_ImportEntities conflict
		1.3 has bug 453 map conversion promt that was not backported to 1.2 (caused merge to conflict a bit)
		usin 1.3 code and checking 1.2 changes manually
  
	using radiant.x86 as Linux target (instead of radiant, didn't fit with the setup procedure)
  
	06/05/2002
	not merging in .dsw .dsp
	an eclass.cpp fixed moved to eclass_def.cpp
	mainframe.cpp is always a bitch to merge, sent several mail comments to list about conflicts that arose
	  MainFrame::OnFileSaveas needed some updates that were not in the diff (correct default prompt)
		(same for MainFrame::OnFileSaveregion)
		MainFrame::OnFileNewproject conflicts a bit, changes have been made in 1.2 and 1.3
		changes in 1.2 seem more crucial, using the 1.2 version, and patched the 1.3 manually over it
		  (might need to be checked, bug #506)
      
	TODO: need to check for parasite g_free that I added back from the file dialog

  - patching in Hydra's code for Half-Life, builds and runs on Linux, need to quickfix on win32 now

  TODO: the image loading is the main problem right now. We should not have any place that scans the 
  extensions, this is done internally to the image load manager? texwindow.cpp does enumeration of the
  minors too .. but that may be legal in this case.

27/3/2002

  Hydra

  Important Changes:

  - Added VFSWAD modules for extracting textures from WAD files.
  - Added ImageHL for loading textures contained in WAD files
  - Updated shaders source code so that you can produce ShadersHL.dll
    (single minor using #ifdefs)
  - MapQ3 source updated so that it can load and save q2 format maps
    provides a multiple minors.
  - Added EClassFGD for loading FGD definition files
    (I documented this code quite well, if you're interested...)
  - Added support for iconsprite() settings in the FGD loader, we set
    eclass_t->skinpath with the name of the sprite
    TODO: write a sprite model plugin.

  Fixes:

  - Fixed incorrect line numbers being reported when script files had // comments in them
  - Removed EClass_Create from the EClass manager _EClassManagerTable
  - Replaced all occurences of "textures/radiant/notex" in shaders.cpp with a define.
  - Fixed a crash in shaders.cpp when there was no default texture.
  - Fixed a possible issue with g_bCancel_Map_LoadFile
  - Added a crash fix for uninitialised patchMesh_t->pSymbiot

  Core Changes Required for HalfLife Support:

  - Set MAX_FLAGS to 16 to support Halflife's extra spawnflags, adjusted
    entity inspector to display the new spawnflags, updated FGD loader
    to load them correctly (previously it only loaded the ones with values <8)
    (Done without breaking the old Q2 code that was commented out)
  - Added GetTokenExtra to the _ScripLibTable
  - Kludged texwindow.cpp to allow loading extension other than "tga" and "jpg"
    TODO: ttimo, we need something in synapse to help with this.
  - Plugin manager requests different API's depending on .game file used.
    TODO: this needs to be done on a PER GAME basis, not PER .GAME FILE.
  - Shaderlist.txt is not parsed on startup if hl.game is used.
    TODO: this needs to be done on a PER ENGINE basis, not PER GAME.

  Cosmetic Changes:

  - Changed MAPQ3's minor_name from "map" to "mapq3" (also adds "mapq2" as a minor)
  - Changed XMAP's minor_name from "xmap" to "mapxml"
  - Changed VFS's minor_name from "quake3" to "pk3", more inline with VFSWAD now.
  - Changed file/Load to file/Import on the menus
  - When a shader (Q3/HL) is not found a message is displayed in the console
    (only once for each shader that is not found).  This is so the user can
    quickly get a list of missing textures/shaders.

26/3/2002
  ydnar
  - initial q3map 2.0 source import
    new tools/quake3/q3map2 directory
	  common/qfiles.h and common/surfaceflags.h modified
	  affects q3map 1.x too, bumped MAX_MAP_BRUSHSIDES to 0x40000
	  will need to write the build scripts and compile on Linux too

    - Degenerate patches are treated like broken brushes. They are ignored, warned about, and selected in Radiant if you ran with the -connect option (or from the BSP menu). This was what was causing the "0 valued axis" error some people were experiencing.

    New entity keys:
    - "_lightmapscale" key for brush entities (worldspawn, func_*). This lets a mapper scale the lightmap samplesize per-entity. For large constructions, 2.0 or 3.0 is a fine value, and keeps BSP size down and compile times low. For those areas you want to have high-detail shadows, make a func_group and use a value of 0.25 or so. It will scale the samplesize value for the surface's shader (default 16) or the -samplesize argument.
    - "modelscale" and "modelscale_vec" keys for misc_models (1.0 = default). This was for proper RTCW support and is available for Quake 3 maps as well. Lets you scale up map models in the world, getting around the MD3 size limitation. The next build of GtkRadiant has SPoG's code to support this in-editor so you can see what effect a scale has.
    - Flare surfaces are now supressed from the BSP. They serve no purpose other than add to the vert & surfacecount in a BSP. These surfaces were created silently when a shader has "light 1" or "q3map_flareshader X." Use the new -flares switch when BSPing your map to have them emitted.

    Changes:
    - GtkRadiant 1.2.4-nightly version increment.
    - Full WolfSDK style lighting enabled with -game wolf, including lightJuniors. This includes linear lights by default (no angle attenuation) and support for the additional RTCW "fade" and "angle" keys, and spawnflag changes, including q3map_nondynamic on light entities. This may require maps being constructed for RTCW with the current toolset to change their light entities. Sorry. :) Note, Wolf-style lighting only works with -light, and not -vlight.
    - Vertex light stitching now uses a near-ambient light check for dark vertexes as opposed to lower-than-average fixups. This preserves some shadow detail better while getting the buried verts lit properly. Comments encouraged.
    - Surfaces' samplesize are now stored in the BSP. This change makes BSPs generated from this version incompatible with all other q3maps. The upside is that -samplesize N is no longer necessary on the -light or -vlight stage. This feature is necessary to support the "_lightmapscale" key.
    - Additional PVS optimizations in lighting.

    Fixes:
    - Will compile for RTCW properly (1.2.1-y12 didn't).
    - No more sparklies where fog meets brush faces. They're split properly now.
    - Crash bug in vlight fixed.
    - Vertex light fixups/stitching is considerably faster.
    - Vertex light fixups ONLY stitch faces with lightmaps. For pointlight surfaces you're on your own.
    - Better snapping logic when merging nearly-coincident vertexes on complex brush windings.
    - Bug where the .prt file had some bogus or nearly-borked portals. They're cleaned up like everything else now.
    - A few stupid bugs in path initialization. Should work better. Also includes TTimo's fixes to my code so it would work properly on Linux.
    - RR2DO2's PCX loading patch for alphamaps. This bug was manifesting itself in the form of offset or incorrect samples being used on terrain entities.
    - A ton of other minor little fixes here and there.

  - multiple games support, list of changes, and TODO:
  NOTE: this is on a 'gameselect' branch for now
  Doxygen documentation should be at http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/doxygen
    for this branch too.

  The installation procedure has changed. The win32 installer is partly ready, linux installer
  will need to be modified too. The editor binary and the Gtk DLLs are installed in a common
  location, i.e. 'C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant' typically. The game specific binaries and modules
  go in the same location as usual, for instance 'C:\Program Files\Quake III Arena\GtkRadiant\'
  (and also 'C:\Program Files\Quake III Arena\GtkRadiant\modules' 'C:\<..>\plugins')

  The environment variables used by the build system (VC6 project files) have been adapted:
  $(QUAKE3RADIANTDIR) is still used
  $(CORERADIANTDIR) is used for the main editor location

  When editor starts, it looks for games/*.game under g_strAppPath and prompts the user for a game
  Once game is selected, parameters are used for regular startup.
  You need to write your own q3.game for now, it will be generated by the setup procedure
  my C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant\games\q3.game looks like that:
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" standalone="yes"?>
  <!-- Q3 game definition file -->
  <!-- those are generated -->
  <game 
    name="Quake III Arena / Quake III: Team Arena and modifications"
	gametools="c:/quake3/Radiant/"
  />

  given that, the editor does a complete startup, and the basics are here for multiple games

  - precise changes:

  g_strToolsPath renamed to g_strGameToolsPath
  most of former g_strAppPath uses g_strGameToolsPath
  the name change was also meant for homogeneity with DIR_GAMETOOLS_* variables we use in the setups
  g_strAppPath still used, points to the main installation path

  added the game selection code in CPrefsDlg::Init
  using several classes and a dialog box, parsing XML files

  - TODO:
  
  the console 'Radiant.log' doesn't catch the game selection stuff as it is now
  initialize it to the main install, without the game setting
  (console logging is a debugging tool anyway, no reason it should go to the proper game folder
  each time)

  the 'preferences reset/cleanup' code is probably broken, specially when used with the .pid checking
  since we check for .pid even before we know where the GameTools path is

  on linux, we need to sanitize the ~/.q3a dir usage. Switch to ~/.radiant, use the version tag
  to maintain things independant, and use the game name to isolate per-game settings?
  ~/.radiant/1.2.0-nightly/quake3/radiant.ini (.pid, .log)
  ~/.radiant/1.2.0-nightly/wolf/..

  also, when looking for those files (.ini mostly), win32 stores them in a main installation, and
  linux has them in ~/.radiant/.. (which is the read/write area). This should be homogenized?
  Maybe by adding a 'Main' to the readonly path and a new variable with 'RW', pointing to 'Main' on
  win32 and to ~/.radiant on linux

11/12/2001
  TTimo

    unifies mathlib code squattered all over the tree
    mainly a merge of tools math code and radiant/mathlib.cpp
    C implementation, using an extern "C" construct for use from C++
    need to check on linux, win32 builds ok
    extracted qboolean code into libs/bytebool.h on the way

  merged TmpMerge-1_1_1 branch back in the trunk, the update process from Alpha 1.1.1 is done

  TTimo - branch TmpMerge-1_1_1
  looking through all remaining .rej files and applying the failed patches accordingly
  bobtoolz is broken, but it's not due to the merge
    the plugin API is different and some things need updated
    (disabled bobtoolz build in contrib/Construct for now)
  same for gensurf
  same for prtview
  same for textool
  setup: replaced the existing stuff with 1.1.1 code
  fixed various things for win32 build, checked correct CRT lib config

10/10/2001

  map module successfully loaded and saved q3dm1, the saved file was then loaded back into 1.1-TA without problems
  rebuilt and checked on win32
  merged IMap back in trunk, fixed some memory conflicts on win32
  Took me a lot more time than I would have liked to, but there's a script tied to the CVS server now, which will post on this list a diff of the docs/developer/CHANGES file whenever it gets updated. This will probably be very handy for me since I'll only have to put update information in the CHANGES file instead of having to post on the list too.
  The script is likely to be a bit laggy, or miss some features (for instance I'd like to extract the branch name .. anyone know how I can get the branch name (Alpha/IMap/HEAD) from the version number?
  PS: I can email this script to anyone who would like to have a look

22/08/2001

  did more work on map module, one big chunk of work left: the core should broadcast interface requests to plugins

  the map module starts to look like something, cleaned up the interface stuff
  started moving the actual code out in the module and removing it from the core
  lots of issues raised on the way, some structures to export, and the macro scheme to access API functions more easily
  it compiles right now, but won't run because it's missing a lot of things .. the process simply happens to be "under way"

04/08/2001
  TTimo
  patched more path code, to look for stuff in "bitmaps/" and "modules/" instead of "tools/bitmaps" and "tools/modules"
  modified the Construct files accordingly
  merged in radiant/ishaders.cpp diff into plugins/shaders/shaders.cpp (PreloadShaders)
  merged in radiant/lbmlib.cpp diff into plugins/images/lbmlib.cpp (Sys_FPrintf)
  checked the .rej and patched a few remaining things
  NOTE
    the diffs are space/tab sensisitive, and we used the "beautify source" a bunch of times, so it's a bit fucked now
    next time, generate the diffs not space sensitive..
  TODO
    map loading is fucked, "textures/" prefix issue?

27/07/2001
  TTimo
  merging recent changes from Alpha branch into the Trunk
  this could not be done with a regular cvs merge because we already did a cvs merge of Alpha into trunk some time ago
  manually built a diff between the current Alpha (now tagged Merge-1_1-TA_1-nightly)
  and the Alpha we had right after the former cvs merge: -r Alpha -D 2000-05-28
  binary files ignored in the diff, only going for source stuff
  built with diff -Nru Reference/ Current/
  then patch -p1 < patchfile
  next, started rebuilding:
    big manual updates were in vfs.cpp and texwindow.cpp
  cleaned up some VFS stuff .. it had an absurd QERAppFileSystem / QERPlugFileSystem scheme
  TODO:
    the ISSetup has not been copied over from Alpha
    OK check the Construct files
    OK radiant/ishaders.cpp no longer exists .. apply the patch on the shader module
    OK radiant/lbmlib.cpp no longer exists .. in the image code?
    OK look at the *.rej files

    http://www.qeradiant.com/faq/index.cgi?file=197

12/06/2001
  TTimo
  - got rid of of SysMsg thing, using SysPrintf and SysFPrintf now
  - got rid of InfoMsg functions (can't remember what it was)
  - changed the m_pfnError in the plugin API to match Radiant's (void)(char *, ...)
  - changed Warning to Sys_Warning, as #define to Sys_FPrintf(SYS_WRN,
  
11/06/2001
  TTimo
  - new map module, in plugins/map, required for execution (linux Makefiles written, win32 needs to be)
    this is using the imap.h interface
  - added Sys_ functions to the main table (Sys_BeginWait Sys_EndWait)
  - got rid of AFX_MANAGE_STATE macros .. those are crappy MFC remnants
  - reverted Spog's changes to the console logging switches to their original behaviour
  - removed m_fVersion from the func table .. we use the size of the table to do the checks
  XMLmap merge from 31/11/2000:
  - started moving the map loading code into a module
  
08/06/2001
  TTimo
  - updates to the plugin loading code, verbose a bit more, and more interesting information

05/06/2001
  TTimo
  - some fixes to vfspk3 string code, using the proper str implementation
  http://www.qeradiant.com/faq/index.cgi?file=175
  - added and tweaked various cons build files, Radiant 1.2 core and required Q3 modules are building now
  - fixes to image module

04/06/2001
  TTimo
  - started using cons for the linux (*NIX) build system
  see http://www.dsmit.com/cons/
  
  SPoG
  - Fixed drawing too much coordinate text in XY window
  - Changed grid line drawing in XY window to be more consistent
  - Fixed clipper-tool-uses-caulk to only apply common/caulk to solid opaque brushes
    (shaders.dll now parses some new surfaceparms)
  - Changed shader parsing to pass over layer information in shaders,
    rather than parsing and ignoring it all
  - Changed misc_model selection to ignore back-facing triangles
  - Added axes to show the grid origin in XY window
  - Changed misc_model rendering and selection to minimise the number of extra
    transformation calculations
  - Fixed texture directory listing to allocate and free memory correctly using vfs
  - Added qglDeleteTextures() to plugin GL API - fixes crash
  - Fixed image.dll to correctly allocate and free memory for jpgs
  - Moved modules to /modules from /plugins, updated win32 project files.
    (linux/mac makefiles will need to be updated)
  - Changed console logging toggle in main() to automatically disable logging after any successful startup
  - Changed console logging to only activate when a Release build finds a .pid file
  - Changed "found .pid" and "logging console output" messageboxes to give a clearer message
  - Added vfsFreeFile - which is kinda redundant if we use g_free and g_malloc for everything
  
31/05/2001
  TTimo
  - cleanup of the win32 project file and C++ options.\
  Turned off exception handling, changed some code generation options and fixed
  some threaded/non-threaded linking problems
  - STL in GtkRadiant or a plugin must now use STLPort
  a custom configured version of STLPort is available at http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/STLPort
  still need to write some guidelines about it
  bascially, we are using STL: iostreams disabled, no namespace, no threading, no exceptions

30/05/2001
  TTimo
  - removed libxml2 from tree, use a seperate libxml2/ directory next to GtkRadiant/ for win32
  libxml2 will be distributed seperately as an archive based on official release (same as win32 Gtk SDK)
  (check on zerowing for the latest archive)
  libxml2 is now used as dynamic shared object on win32, makes sense since many module will rely on it
  - cleaned q3map, removed GL dependencies
  - updated Debug and Release builds on win32, it compiles and runs now

28/05/2001
  Spog
  - moved vfsExtractRelativePath and vfsGetFullPath to vfs.cpp in vfspk3,
    added vfsExtractRelativePath and vfsGetFullPath to IFileSystem. Copied BuildShortPathName() from qe3.cpp to vfs.cpp as a Temp fix.
  - Changed Error() calls in bmp.cpp as a Temp fix, they relied on definition of Error in qe3.cpp. Should probably use Error() from cmdlib instead.
  - Fixed unresolved external in jpgload.obj - merged bufsize argument into jpeg_stdio_src from Alpha branch... assuming Alpha is the newer version.
  - Changed GtkWidget* to void* in image.cpp.. this could be cleaned up more.. i only did enough to make it compile.
  - Added jpeg.cpp to msvc project for image.dll.. changed declaraction of LoadJPG() in image.cpp to an extern... is this correct?
  - TODO: update vfs.cpp, vfspak.cpp and vfs.h in plugins/vfspak
  - fixed unresolved external load_pixmap() - merged load_pixmap declaration from Alpha branch into gtkmisc.cpp
  - moved vfsBasePromptPath() to qe3.cpp as a Temp fix - not currently required in vfs module, but it will be in future.
  - two calls to free() in texwindow.cpp freeing memory allocated by vfs module, causing debug assert errors - changed them to g_free()
  - TODO: Delete vfs.cpp and vfs.h from /radiant
  TTimo
  - additional fixes after Spog's merge (linux version), removed messaging.cpp messaging.h (name changed to ui.h ui.cpp)
    updated linux makefile accordingly
  - merge of Alpha version into trunk (massive amount of changes and merges, not detailed)

25/05/2001
  TTimo (Alpha branch)
  - merged the recent MacOS branch back into Alpha
  this makes a potential source codebase for a MacOS release

  - Rewrote camwindow drawing to only change opengl state within the camwnd's member functions
	fixes all rendering modes to be more consistent, speeds up rendering

--------- GtkRadiant 1.1-TA win32 and linux release ----------

13/05/2001

  Spog (patched in TTimo) (Alpha branch)
  - Fixed "Fix entity-target/targetname collisions" to use next available tN if tN, else use next available name_N
  - Changed patch point selection to pick already-selected points in preference over non-selected
  - Changed RemoveCols and RemoveRows to not extrapolate unless a col/row is selected

11/05/2001
  TTimo (Alpha branch)
  - final fix pass to the generated version and about message tags
  - improved texture adjustment code (shift+arrows shortcuts)

  texture adjustment commands now affect the texture relatively to their current orientation
  they will move along their texture axis, and not along world axis
  the texture adjustment commands are now interpreted to be more intuitive:
    Radiant will match the up/down/right/left translation messages to the face that is affected
	depending on the way the camera is looking at the face, the right move commands will be used

  changes start in Select_ShiftTexture, using new ShiftTextureRelative_Camera

  ShiftTextureRelative_Camera uses several new functions:

  // get the two relative texture axes for the current texturing
  BrushPrimit_GetRelativeAxes(f, vecS, vecT);

  MatchViewAxes does the matching between up/down/left/right commands and world directions:
  // vec defines a direction in geometric space and P an origin point
  // the user is interacting from the camera view
  // (for example with texture adjustment shortcuts)
  // and intuitively if he hits left / right / up / down 
  //   what happens in geometric space should match the left/right/up/down move in camera space
  // axis = 0: vec is along left/right
  // axis = 1: vec is along up/down
  // sgn = +1: same directions
  // sgn = -1: opposite directions
  // Implementation:
  //   typical use case is giving a face center and a normalized vector
  //   1) compute start and endpoint, project them in camera view, get the direction
  //     depending on the situation, we might bump into precision issues with that
  //   2) possible to compute the projected direction independently?
  //     this solution would be better but right now I don't see how to do it..
  void CamWnd::MatchViewAxes(const vec3_t P, const vec3_t vec, int &axis, float &sgn)

  // shift a texture (texture adjustments) along it's current texture axes
  // x and y are geometric values, which we must compute as ST increments
  // this depends on the texture size and the pixel/texel ratio
  void ShiftTextureRelative_BrushPrimit( face_t *f, float x, float y)

  those functions are using various new utility functions:
  
    // GL matrix product
    void GLMatMul(vec_t M[4][4], vec_t A[4], vec_t B[4]);

    // project a 3D point onto the camera space
    // we use the GL viewing matrixes
    // this is the implementation of a glu function (I realized that afterwards): gluProject
    void CamWnd::ProjectCamera(const vec3_t A, vec_t B[2])

  - UI abstraction layer (interfaces for Gtk MFC and Q3 UI)

09/05/2001
  Maj (Alpha branch)
  - new splash screen

  Spog (patched in by TTimo) (Alpha branch)
  
  patcing in changes:
  - moving void VectorSnap(vec3_t point, int snap); to mathlib
  - NOTE: STL dependency removed .. leaving this comment
    this will rely on M$ implementation of STL on win32 and the libstdc++ for linux
    it should work fine for basic stuff
      but M$ implementation doesn't follow the standards when it comes to advanced stuff
    it is probably better to leave the STL header in local files and not go towards including it directly from qe3.h

  Spog's Changelog:
  
  rushing this a bit.. make sure you check it doesn't remove anything you 
  changed. This only contains changes within /radiant .. i'm pretty sure I didn't

  Hydra (patched in TTimo) (Alpha branch)
  http://fenris.lokigames.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3458 :
  - *.pfb filter

  SpoG (patched in TTimo) (Alpha branch)
  - updated setup data: entities.def common.shader(Q3) and common-spog.pk3
  http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25 :
  - Patches: Curve > matrix > redisperse > rows/columns
    I changed this function to treat a patch as multiple 3by3 sections when doing 
  redispersal of control points. The effect is that green patch points are never 
  moved. I also removed the call to Patch_Naturalize, so the texture coordinates 
  are not changed (user can hit ctrl+n to naturalize afterwards if desired).
  - rewrote the patch_captexture function to be more reliable
  - Fixed YZ view drawing and selection being mirrored on plane X=0
  - Fixed X and Z rotation direction to be clockwise as shown on the toolbar button 
    icons
  http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8 :
  - Fixed: Removed orientation-switching hack to fix 2pt-clip orientation problems, 
    originally stemming from ass-backwards representation of grid axes. Fixed 
    clipper to generate 3rd clip point correctly for each axis instead.
  - Fixed: Stopped clipper-caulker from NOT applying caulk if the first face of a 
    brush was "common/caulk".
