 * \brief
 * Class which accepts OpenGLRenderable objects during the first pass of
 * rendering.
 * 
 * Each Renderable in the scenegraph is passed a reference to a
 * RenderableCollector, on which the Renderable sets the necessary state
 * variables and then submits its OpenGLRenderable(s) for later rendering. A
 * single Renderable may submit more than one OpenGLRenderable, with a different
 * state each time -- for instance a Renderable model class may submit each of
 * its material surfaces separately with the respective shaders set beforehand.
 * 
 * \todo
 * This class probably doesn't need to be a state machine, convert it to a 
 * single submit method with necessary parameters.
