/**
 * greebo: This is the abstract definition of a SpacePartition node.
 *
 * A SpacePartition node has the following properties:
 *
 * - It always has valid bounds (in the form of an AABB).
 * - Each node can have any amount of children [0..infinity)
 * - A node with 0 children is called a Leaf.
 * - Each node can have exactly one parent (which is NULL for the root node).
 * - The collectivity of nodes form a tree whereas the topmost one is the largest.
 * - Each node can host any amount of "members" (member == scene::INode).
 *
 * It is the task of the ISpacePartitionSystem to allocate and manage these nodes.
 * scene::INodes are "linked" to the correct ISPNodes through the ISPacePartition's
 * link() methods - and are unlinked through the unlink() method of the latter.

 * which is the root ISPNode.
 *
 * The link() method makes sure the given node is added as member to the ISPNode it fits best.
 * The unlink() method can be used to remove a node from the tree again.
 *
 * Note: It's not allowed to call link() for nodes which are already linked into the tree.
 * It's safe to call unlink() for any node at any time, even multiple times in a row. 
 * The unlink() method will return true if the node had been linked before.
